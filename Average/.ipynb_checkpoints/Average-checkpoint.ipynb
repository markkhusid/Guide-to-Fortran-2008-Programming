    "This simple FORTRAN program uses an allocatable array to store a series of user entered reals numbers. It then uses the built-in SUM function to easily sum over all of the elements in the array. The SUM command makes FORTRAN extremely powerful for computing series expansions or series sum calculations. It is also extremely useful for numerical calculations of integrals and convolution integrals in control systems engineering. \n",
